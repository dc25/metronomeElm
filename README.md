# Simulation of mechanical metronome.  

## Graphics implemented both as collage and SVG

Demo: http://dc25.github.io/metronomeElm/

This project/exercise started out as an implementation of the rosetta code task "Metronome", http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Metronome .  Along the way I decided to try implementing the graphics in SVG and for comparision purposes I left the original collage functionality in place.
